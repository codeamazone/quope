## quope

A simple App that gives you a random inspirational quote.

Just push the Button.

The project folder contains several files where I played around with different APIs.
The relevant file for the quote app is quope/quope.py

To run it, open the project directory in your bash, go to the quope/quope directory and enter

```
python quope.py
```

To get your random quote, push the button on the GUI that has appeared.
